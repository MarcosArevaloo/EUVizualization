        The Eurpean Union: A Quick Vizualization

    <p>    The European Union (EU) sits at the height of political power in the European continent. Composed of the 27
        countries shaded blue above, the EU is the economic and political powerhouse that controls much of the European 
        continent. Each member gets a certain amount of votes that go into its representation in the Union,
        similar to the U.S. House of Representatives in regards to stateship and votes in the House. However, what 
        exacly determines how many votes each country gets. Could it be population? The following graph explores
        this further.

<p>     As can be seen from the graph above, we can see somewhat of a stronger correlation between population and Parliamentary seats
    as opposed to GDP per capita and seats. To clarify, GDP per capita is defined as the Gross Domestic Product per person,
    which is the straightforwar division of the total GDP by the total population of a country, which in short can be used as an estimate
    to the average wealth on average per citizen of that country.  This can be especially seen by Luxeumbeurg, the uppermost point that produces over a whopping $100,000
    GDP per capita, yet holds only 6 seats in parliament as it is one of the smaller EU countries. Likewise, we see further
    evidence of this trend with the larger countries of Italy, France, Germany, and Spain, who in addition to being four of the largest
    countries in the EU also hold a large percentage of the seats.
